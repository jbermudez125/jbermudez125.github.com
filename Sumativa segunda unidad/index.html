	<center><h1>Locked-in syndrome ilness</h1></center>
	<p class="introduction">This is one of the most strange ilness, you can watch one of the next resources to learn about it. Also there is a game, that is a puzzle with words related to the ilness.</p>
	<p class="doc1"><center><h3>Introduction </h3>	</center>
 <p>This inquiry is made with the objective of learn about a new illness and how it attacks the different systems of the body, how works inside the body, and how we can treat, or the studies that the people has done to find a treatment, a cure, or something that can help to the people that have this illness, is important to know about how works this types of illness of the mind, because, the mind is one of  part of the bodies that we can’t understand completely, it function
In this document we will talk all about this illness, their symptoms, the systems of the body that affect, why this illness happens and how we can treat this disease.</p>

<center><h3>Description Of The Problem </h3></center>
	<p> The Locked-In Syndrome principally called for this form in 1966 to describe a group of neurological symptoms characterised by quadriplegia and anarthria but with a little mistake or special feature, the conscience of a person is intact and pacient can be expressed of  different forms. Is a neurological problem with highly disabling symptoms, this illness can start to see forms like quadriplegia, anarthria, preservation of consciousness and the ability to express by ocular movements.
Occurs principally due a bilateral injury to the ventral portion of the bridge, with the consequence of quadriplegia but the somatosensory and neuronal pathways stay intacs and the conscience of patient is in there, and finally exist three types of this illness:
1) Clásic: have quadriplegia and anarthria but preserve of conscience and motility ocular and blinking
2) Incomplete: Similar to classic, but patient preserve other more movements volutaries besides to the ocular
3) Total: have quadriplegia and anarthria and total ophthalmoplegia.</p>

<center><h3>Symptomatology </h3></center>
<p>	 Generally, 5 criteria are considered that can define the presence of locked-in syndrome in most cases. <br>
-	Tetraplegia or tetraparesis  <br>
-	Maintenance of superior cortical functions. <br>
-	Severe aphonia or hypophonia. <br>
-	Ability to open eyes and perform vertical movements. <br>
-	Using eye movements and blinking as a means of communication <br>
However, depending on the location and severity of the injury, several more signs and symptoms may be noted. <br>
-	Anticipatory signs: headache, vertigo, paraesthesia, hemiparesis, diplopia. <br>
-	Preservation of the waking state and consciousness. <br>
-	Motor disorders: tetraplegia, anarthria, facial diplegia, decerebrate rigidity (abnormal posture with arms and legs extended and head and neck bowed back). <br>
-	Eye signs: paralysis of the bilateral conjugation of horizontal eye movements, maintenance of blinking and vertical eye movements. <br>
-	Remaining motor activity: distal finger movements, facial and tongue movement, head flexion. <br>
-	Involuntary episodes: grunting, crying, oral automatisms, among others. <br>
In addition, two phases or moments can be distinguished in the presentation of the captivity syndrome <br>
-	Initial or acute phase: characterized by anarthria, respiratory involvement, total muscle paralysis and episodes of loss of consciousness. <br>
-	Post-acute or chronic phase: consciousness, respiratory function, and vertical eye movements are fully restored. <br>

<center><h3>Causes And Consequences </h3></center>
<p>	 Causes
	This illness are produced by an alteration on the brain stem, specifically occurs due a bilateral injury to the ventral portion of the bridge, also is link with injuries in the lower encephalon and the the up encephalon no was damage, also can be produce by cerebrovascular accidents that generally affecting to the basilar artery. The injuries usually are produced on the corticobulbar, corticospinal, and corticopontine pathways that developed the paralysis and anarthria.
Other causes little common are mesencephalic injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain stem tumors and others.
Consequences
Produce a head trauma, variation in nervous functions, other consequence is produce quadriplegia, anarthria, complete paralysis on voluntaries muscles except the eyes muscles, the patient cant express by verbal movements and finally the somatosensory and neuronal pathways stay intacs and the conscience of patient is in there.</p>

<center><h3>Treatments And / Or Cures </h3></center>
 <p>There is no cure or treatment to this illness but there are some therapies to help to the respiration or to eat, this therapies must be started as soon as possible, then of identify the disease, because, is important to start because if they are not done, then the problem will be more, because there will be complications with the respiration; basically these therapies are to prevent respiratory complications, as infections, also the doctor give nutritional support;know then of a lot of studies, they can communicate using electric impulses, or other strategies, for example they teach to communicate through flashing, or the movement of the eyes.
The new technological advances also help to treat this sickness, there is something called brain-computer interfaces, this use the nervous  impulses, that becomes in electrical impulses that go to the computer and produce the movement, as well there are mouth prosthesis, that through the nervous impulses they can communicate and have access to internet, and as a way of movement they use a special chair, that help to move independently of a person to help you move. All the treatments depend on the person, because there are some people with this syndrome that then of a while died, and other people that get recover their movement partially and live 10 or 20 years more.</p>

<center><h3>How this illness affects the different systems of body  </h3></center>
	<p>principally this illness affect the nervous system because the damage is produce practically in brain or injuries in some parts of the brain, and the brain is connected with all the nervous system affecting the mobility of person, also the muscular system is affected because without mobility in our body the muscles can atrophy and hurt and all the body is paralysis with the exception of eyes muscles, also the circulatory system can be a little affect because if you don't do anything exercise your body can star to receive less oxygen and pump less oxygen causing affecting the metabolism process.</p>
